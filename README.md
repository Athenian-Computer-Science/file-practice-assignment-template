# File Practice

## Problem Description
In this exercise, you will create a text file and save it in this repo. Then, write aprogram that reads the file and
 prints it 3 times:
1) Print the contents once by reading the entire file at once
2) Print the contents by looping over the file object
3) Print the contents by storing the lines in a list and then working with them outside the `with` block

Next, use the  `replace()` method to replace a specific word with another word (for every occurence.) Print the
 modified text to the screen.
